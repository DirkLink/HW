# Normal Mode
# Write a Register class with a change function that takes an amount of money and returns the number of quarters, 
# dimes, nickels and pennies needed to produce that amount:

# r = Register.new r.change 0.99 # => [3, 2, 0, 4]

# Hard Mode
# Option 1 - OO

# Write a set of tests to verify that your register works (preferably before writing the register)
# Initialize the register with a fixed number of each coin. Note as the coins are distributed, 
# and e.g. use 2 nickels when you run out of dimes. What should happen when 
# you can't make change at all? Write specs for it and then implement it.
# Option 2 - Enumerable

# Allow for the addition / removal of coins e.g. we phase out the penny but add a 33Â¢ piece.
